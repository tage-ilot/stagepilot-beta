"""Semantically validate that Actions jobs use the correct runner policy.

Policy: Linux jobs must stay pinned to the self-hosted Linux runner
(`[self-hosted, stagepilot-linux]`) — that runner is free, fast, and already
proven, so Linux jobs must never silently drift onto a paid hosted
`ubuntu-*` runner. Native Windows/macOS jobs, however, run on GitHub-hosted
runners now that the repository is public (hosted Actions minutes are free
and unlimited for public repos on standard runners), so those jobs may use
hosted `windows-*`/`macos-*` labels.
