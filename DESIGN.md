description: >-
  A dark, high-contrast live-production control surface. Calm slate panels,
  one hot coral accent for "live / primary", and unmistakable status colors,
  readable at arm's length in a dim booth. Values are AS RENDERED today
  unless marked CHANGED (decided) or OPEN (still needs an answer).

## Overview

StagePilot is used by a tech running a live service, often in a dim booth,
glancing at a screen while their hands are on something else. The interface
is a **control surface, not a marketing page**: dark and low-glare, with large
legible numbers, generous hit targets, and colour that carries meaning. It
should feel calm when everything is fine and become impossible to miss when it
is not.

1. **Calm slate, one hot accent.** Everything is a dark blue-grey panel except
   the one thing that matters *right now*, which gets coral.
2. **Colour means state.** Green, amber, red are reserved for status, never
   decoration.
3. **Each service has an identity hue** so a user can tell Playback from
   Services without reading.

## Our look

**PROPOSED, drawn from what the app already does. Edit freely.** The style in
one line: **8-bit meets film flare, with a modern touch.** The app is a calm,
modern control surface (Inter, clean panels, clear status colours) with two
signatures that make it ours: a little pixel-art character and a warm,
cinematic glow. Both are accents. Neither takes over.

### 8-bit: where it lives (system moments only)
- **Yes:** the startup/loading bar and the phone spinner (stepped pixel
  stripes, hard 5px offset shadow, `image-rendering: pixelated`, animation in
  `steps()`), and the outlined arcade wordmark (StagePilot Logo with its 1px
  black outline), and the generic pixel-art service icons
  (checklist, monitor, audio tracks, lights).
- **Rule:** pixel styling marks *the app doing something itself* (starting,
  loading, connecting, failing). It is blue for progress, amber when slow, red
  when failed.
- **No:** pixel fonts for body text or labels, pixelated borders or corners on
  panels and buttons, retro "game" wording, 8-bit sound or icons everywhere.
  Controls stay modern: 8px corners, Inter, clean borders.

### Film flare: where it lives (light and warmth)
- **Yes:** the photo background, the warm brown-red soft shadow lit from the
  upper left, the coral wash and left rail on the live item, and the faint
  warm glow behind the timer.
- **Rule:** coral light means *live or selected*. Glow is earned: it shows on
  at most one live item per view. Everything else is quiet slate.
- **No:** glow, neon outlines or gradients on ordinary panels, buttons or text;
  cool grey or pure black shadows; extra film effects (grain overlays, lens
  flares, vignettes) stacked on top of the photo.

### Modern: the baseline
Inter (bundled), 8px/12px corners, the three widget borders, tokens only,
44/36px targets, plain verb-and-object labels, visible status with words.

### Avoid (generic defaults that would blur our identity)
Purple-to-blue gradients; glassmorphism on every panel (blur only on the
header and popovers, as today); the same icon + heading + text card repeated
for everything; a pulsing dot on things that are not live; invented numbers or
metrics; decorative animation that moves or delays a control; gradient text;
emoji as icons; nested rounded boxes that add no hierarchy; and any new colour
that is not a status, a service, or coral.

### Check before shipping a screen
1. **Does the 8-bit or film touch appear only where the rules above allow?**
2. **Remove each decorative layer in your head.** If meaning, state or action
   survive, delete it.
3. Run `audit-ai-design-slop` (evidence-based review of generic patterns and
   real UI defects) and `web-design-guidelines` (accessibility and UX review)
   on the changed files; run `design.md lint` on this file.

## Colors
- **Surfaces.** The page is `background` over the film-flare photo (decided: keep the photo). Cards sit on
  `panel` / `panel-strong` / `card`. Inputs, dialogs and toasts use
  `surface-950` (near black), so they read as wells.
- **Text ladder (decided).** Three colours: `text` (`#f8f4ec`, the warm
  off-white: headings, key figures, timers, text you type) > `text-body`
  (`#cbd5e1`, default copy) > `text-muted` (`#94a3b8`, labels, kickers, hints,
  placeholders). **`text-strong` is not a colour:** it is `text` set bolder
  (weight 700) for emphasis. The old cool-white `#f1f5f9` is gone. The old
  `text-quiet` (slate-500, 72 uses, only 3.4:1) is replaced by `text-muted`
  (7:1 or better on every surface).
- **Primary (`#ff6238`, coral)** marks the live item (now-playing rail,
  current song row), the layout-save action, and the expanded/selected state.
- **Text on fills (DECIDED rule): light text on dark fills, dark text on light
  fills.** Most of the app is dark, so light text stays the norm.
  - Light fills (coral, amber, emerald, sky-400, fuchsia-400): dark text
    (`on-primary`).
  - Dark red fill (`danger-solid` `#e11d48`, 4.7:1 with white): white text
    (`on-danger`); rose-500 was too light for that (3.7:1).
  - Where an **error** colour needs dark text (a light rose fill such as
    rose-300/400), use dark **red** `on-danger-soft` `#4c0519`, never black.
  - **Minimum 4.5:1** for any text, and this file is linted for it.
- **One solid action colour (DECIDED): coral is the only primary button.**
  Every panel's main action (Save, Connect, Unlock, Update and Restart) is
  coral with dark text. Integration hues are for identity only: tinted
  borders, tinted secondary buttons, panel accents. Consequences in code:
  - "Save general settings" (StagePilot panel, red) and the MIDI save (magenta) become
    coral. Red means error or destructive; a plain save should not look like one.
  - "Update and Restart" (sky solid) and the two PIN/unlock buttons (sky) become coral.
  - "Use <plan>" in the Services plan picker (amber solid) becomes a
    tinted Services (blue) button. Amber is only for warnings.
  - `danger-solid` stays for destructive confirms only.
- **Status colours** are fixed app-wide: `success` = connected/running/ready,
  `warning` = connecting/delayed/needs attention, `danger` = error or
  destructive, `neutral` = disconnected/idle. Use `*-text` for words and
  `*-soft` for dots on dark panels. `info` (sky) is for neutral informational
  actions, not state.
- **Service colours (decided)** tint a service's setup panel. **Playback is
  fuchsia** (MIDI is configured under Playback and has no colour of its own).
  Services is blue, Presentation is orange, Lights is sky. Never reuse these
  for status. **Advanced** parts of a service's setup use a muted version of
  the service colour (`advanced-*`, the hue mixed half-way with `text-muted`)
  so they read as secondary. Decided: mixed 30% hue / 70% grey so the difference from the main colour is easy to see.
- **Dashboard names (decided): generic, not brand names.** The dashboard says
  **Services** and **Presentation**, not Planning Center and ProPresenter, so
  the app reads as usable with many tools and avoids implying an endorsement.
  A brand name appears only where the user is signing in to, or an API is
  specific to, that company's product (for example the Planning Center OAuth
  screen). Today the code still uses the brand names in the setup checklist,
  accessible labels and setup panels; those move to the generic names in the
  migration.
- **Live controls (decided: keep four colours).** The Manual controls widget
  uses colour to show how much a press changes a running show: **green**
  (Start next, Restart current: moves the show forward), **orange**
  (Previous: steps back), **blue** (Reload plan: nothing on stage changes),
  **red** (Stop timer, Reset position: halts or rewinds). They are outlined
  at rest and fill on hover, with dark text on green and orange fills, white
  on blue and red. The red hover fill is darkened one step (rose-600,
  4.7:1) because rose-500 with white text was 3.7:1. These do not follow the
  coral-only primary rule on purpose: they are a severity scale, not "actions".
- **Widget borders (decided: three)** are white at 6/10/18% opacity so they sit right on any
  surface. `border` (10%) is the default. The old 5% and 7% merged into `border-subtle`; the old 15% and 20% (the least used) merged into `border-medium`.
- The **retro loading bar** is blue pixel-art, deliberately not coral
  (decided: keep). Use it lightly; its contrast against the coral/slate UI is
  the point. **Decided: remove the white "scan" bar that sweeps along its
  leading edge** (`.loading-progress-scan` in `index.css`, a `<span>` in
  `App.tsx`). About 20 hardcoded hex values in `index.css`.

## Typography
- **Inter, bundled** (decided): self-hosted variable font, no CDN, so the
  desktop app looks the same offline and on every OS. Not yet implemented;
  today the stack falls back to the OS UI font.
- **StagePilot Logo** (`assets/logo-font.ttf`) is for the wordmark only, with a
  1px black outline (`.font-brand`).
- **Sizes (decided):** `text-sm` 14px (197 uses), `text-xs` 12px (134),
  `text-lg` (13), `text-base` (5), `text-xl` (3), `text-2xl` (3), `text-4xl`
  (2), and **one micro size, 11px**, replacing `0.6rem` / `0.65rem` / `0.68rem`.
- **Weights:** 600 labels and buttons (90), 700 headings and badges (84),
  900 small chips (13), 800 kickers.
- **Timer:** light-weight **monospace**, tabular numerals,
  `clamp(3rem, 5vw, 5.4rem)`, tracking `-0.06em`. **Song title** (live
  panel heading) is a separate style: Inter 900,
  `clamp(2rem, 3.2vw, 3.65rem)`, tracking `-0.045em`. These are two different
  elements, not a conflict.
- **Tracking (decided): three steps.** `0.05em` (Tailwind `tracking-wider`,
  uppercase labels, 56 uses), `0.18em` (kickers; absorbs the 0.14 / 0.2 / 0.22
  one-offs), `0.35em` (display).
- **Placeholders (decided):** `text-muted`. No placeholder style exists today.

## Layout
- 4px base unit. Most common: padding `px-3` (118) / `py-2` (85) / `py-2.5`
  (45); gaps `gap-3` (49) / `gap-2` (35); panel padding `p-4` (18) / `p-5` (12).
- Page capped at 1700px and centred; minimum supported width 320px.
- **Breakpoints:** Tailwind defaults. `sm:` 35 uses, `lg:` 12, `xl:` 10,
  `md:` 7. `lg` (1024px) is the phone/tablet vs desktop split. Components that
  resize inside the dashboard use **container queries** (`@container`,
  8.5/10/18/36/46rem), not viewport queries.
- Dashboard is a drag/resize grid (GridStack) with 5px gutters; see
  `docs/dashboard-layout.md`.
- **Tap targets (decided):** **44px** for live controls (timer, cue and manual
  controls, dialog actions) and for every input; **36px** for all other
  buttons. Today only 5 files use `min-h-11`; most buttons are about 38px, so
  the 36px tier mostly matches what exists.
- **Stacking order** (`z-index`):

  | Layer | z | Used by |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | In-widget controls | 10 | widget handles, header |
  | Menus | 20 | Services plan menu |
  | Header chip | 40 | system-status chip |
  | Popovers, confirm dialogs | 50 | discard-changes, Playback discover confirm, Services length preview, tooltips |
  | Title bar | 100 | desktop title bar (sticky) |
  | Update dialog | 100 | same level as the title bar (decided: stays) |
  | Fatal toasts | 110 | crash-loop and global-error toasts |
  | Error boundary | 120 | full-screen crash screen |

  Above the title bar: both toasts and the error boundary. Level with it: the
  update dialog. Below it: the three confirm dialogs at 50 and all popovers.
  **Decided to keep as is.** The title bar holds the window's drag area and
  close/minimise controls; leaving it reachable under a routine confirm means
  a user is never trapped in a dialog, which is how native apps behave. Only
  fatal states (crash toasts, error screen) and the update dialog, which is
  about the app itself, cover it.

## Elevation & Depth
- **Default shadow (decided; the old "printed" offset shadow is deleted):** soft, layered and warm. Light
  comes from the upper-left, like the film-flare photo, so shadows fall down
  and to the right in a brown-red (`rgb(22 13 12)`), not cool black, plus a
  faint warm inner highlight on the top-left edge. Value is in the
  `elevation.default` token. Rendered over the real background next to the old
  one: it separates well and looks more physical; its weakest spot is the
  right edge over the darkest part of the image, which the 10% white border
  covers.
- `elevation.overlay` (dialogs, toasts, popovers) is a stronger version of
  the same idea and replaces `shadow-2xl`. **Proposed, not yet previewed.**
- The old "printed" offset shadow is deleted (decided); `elevation.default` is the only panel shadow.
- **Strength:** `elevation.default` is level 1 until you pick a stronger level from `elevation-options` (5 levels, each darker). The dialog and toast shadow scales with it.
- Live panel: 5px coral left rail with a faint glow. Hover on cards raises
  border opacity, not size.
- Dragging a widget: opacity ~0.78 plus a large drop shadow.
- Glass: `backdrop-blur-xl` (5 uses) on header/popover chrome.

## Shapes
- **8px** (`rounded-lg`, 157 uses) is the control radius, and the bare
  `rounded` (4px, 12 uses) becomes 8px (decided).
- **12px** for **all** panels and cards (decided; setup panels move from 16px).
- **16px** for toasts only. **Full** for pills and dots.

## Motion

- Micro-interactions 140ms; live reveals 420ms; status colour 180ms;
  expand/collapse 500ms; status-card morph 275ms linear; loading bar steps.
  Easing `cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)`.
- **Everything must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** (a global override
  already exists in `index.css`; keep it).

## Components
- **Panel (one recipe, two variants; decided):** `panel` fill, widget border
  border, 12px radius, `elevation.default`. Variant `panel-setup` adds the
  coral-to-clear 120° wash and 20px padding. The `!important` overrides on
  `.setup-panel` go away when they merge.
- **Status card:** icon tile + title + status dot and word + detail line.
  Collapses to an icon-only tile in compact mode.
- **Live (now-playing) panel:** coral rail, 135° coral wash fading out by 42%,
  oversize tabular timer.
- **Buttons.** Height: 44px for live controls, 36px for everything else.
  - *Solid* (primary): coral, dark text.
  - *Tinted* (most of the app): `hue @ 10%` fill, `hue @ 20-30%` border, light
    `hue-200` text, `hue @ 20%` on hover.
  - Disabled: 40% opacity (a few use 50%; normalise to 40%), `cursor-not-allowed`.
  - **Label shadow (decided):** light text on a dark or tinted button gets a small very-dark-grey shadow (`text-shadow.on-dark-text`). **Dark text gets no shadow.** A light shadow under dark text was tried and rejected by the owner because it looks bad (it reads as a blurry halo). If dark labels ever need more punch, change the fill or the text colour, not add a shadow.
  - Primary = coral (decided). Secondary = tinted in the panel's hue.
- **Inputs (decided):** `surface-950`, widget border, 8px radius, 44px
  tall, `text-muted` placeholder. Native checkboxes (7), `accent-rose-500` on 3.
- **Badges/pills:** full radius, uppercase, 700 weight, hue at 10-15% fill with
  matching light text.
- **Inline alerts:** 8px radius, hue at 10% fill, 20-30% border, `role="alert"`
  (11) or `role="status"` (7).
- **Dialogs:** `fixed inset-0`, `scrim`, centred `surface-950` card, 12px
  radius, `elevation.overlay`. Actions are 44px.
- **Toasts:** fixed bottom corner (left = global error, right = crash-loop),
  16px radius, rose border, `elevation.overlay`.
- **Focus:** 2px `primary-focus` outline, 3px offset, global
  (`:focus-visible`). Never remove.
- **Icons:** no icon library; service icons are PNGs in `assets/`.
- **Scrollbar:** 9px, `scrollbar-track`, slate-700 (`#334155`) thumb.

## Patterns

Everything here is **PROPOSED** until the owner confirms it; items he has
answered are marked **(decided)**. Principle behind all of it: **anyone can use
the app with no training.** No hunting and no manuals: each control is where
the user expects it, labels say exactly what will happen, and the choices
offered are the ones that make sense at that moment. Nothing is kept just
because the current code does it.

### Responsive behaviour
- The status cards switch design at **1000px** viewport width (not just
  shrink): **Wide** = icon tile + title + status dot + status word + detail
  line; **Compact** = icon tile only, with the status dot and word beneath it
  (title and detail stay in the accessible label and the opened panel). Five
  cards always fit in one row.
- `lg` (1024px) is the phone/tablet vs desktop split for everything else.
- Phone layout is a first-class design, not a squeezed desktop: single column,
  44px targets everywhere, dialogs full-width with actions stacked.

### Startup and sign-in screens
- **Desktop startup:** centred wordmark (`brand-hero`), the blue pixel loading
  **bar**, one headline, one detail line.
- **Remote / phone loading (decided): a circular pixel spinner _instead of_
  the bar**, with the same headline and detail text. (Today the code shows the
  spinner **and** the bar together on phones: that is a bug against this rule.)
  The spinner follows the bar's states: blue = loading, amber = taking longer
  than usual, red and stopped = failed.
- The white lead-in line on the bar is removed.
- **Remote sign-in (PIN or login):** a single centred card with the wordmark,
  one sentence of purpose, the field(s), and **one coral button**. Errors appear
  under the field, in `danger-text`, announced to screen readers.

### Choice fields and menus
- **Choosing one value from a list = a styled native select** (input look,
  44px, chevron on the right). Works on phones, keyboard and screen readers for
  free. There are 15 today in 3 different looks; they become one.
- **Choosing an action = an action menu** (button with a chevron that opens a
  card): `surface-950`, `border-medium`, 8px radius, `elevation.overlay`,
  items 44px tall, current item checked, arrow keys + Escape. Only for several
  variants of one action, such as "Update service plan".

### Connection method (decided: MIDI is a method, not a brand)
A connection may be reachable in more than one way. The ways are shown as a
**Connection method** select at the top of Basic, so alternates are where the
user looks, not hidden behind a toggle:
- **Playback:** `Playback API` (main) or `MIDI` (alternate).
- **Lights:** `MIDI` (the main method today; a method select appears only when
  a second method exists).
- When only one method exists, show it as a line of text ("Sends cues by MIDI"),
  not a select with one item.
Changing the method swaps the fields beneath it. MIDI is a protocol, not a
company, so the word stays in the UI.

### Collapsible sections ("Advanced")
- **One pattern for every collapsed section** (today there are five: a ▸ text
  button, `<details>`, a checkbox row, a bordered button, a plain toggle).
- A full-width 44px row: chevron + label on the left, and on the right **a
  one-line summary of what is inside** when closed (for example
  `Port 8080 · Channel 1`), so a user rarely has to open it.
- Colour: the service's muted `advanced-*` tone for chevron and label; the open
  area gets a 3px left bar in the same tone. Basic is never inside a collapsed
  section; Advanced always comes after Basic. Motion: 500ms expand, honouring
  reduced motion.

### Telling expandable things apart (PROPOSED)
In beta 31, "Connect a specific computer", "Recent activity" and
"Alternate connection: MIDI settings" are three near-identical grey rows that
do three different jobs. Rule: **a row's shape says what kind of thing it is.**
1. **A way of connecting (Playback API vs MIDI) is never a collapsed row.** It
   is the **Connection method** segmented control at the top of the panel,
   labelled **Main** / **Alternate**. The selected segment takes the service
   tone; when the alternate is selected, the tab and header badge say so
   (`Connected · MIDI`) and a neutral banner explains how to switch back. The
   existing "Playback connection type" select in Advanced is promoted to this.
2. **Extra options = Advanced:** the one tinted row with a one-line summary.
3. **Read-only information (Recent activity) = Activity:** neutral grey with a
   dashed top rule and a count badge (`12 events`), no service tone.
4. **A one-off value (a specific computer address) is a choice in the field it
   belongs to** ("Other computer…" at the end of the computer select), not a
   separate collapsed row.
Words: "Alternate connection: MIDI settings" becomes **MIDI** under
**Connection method**, and "Main" / "Alternate" are labels on the segments.

### Vocabulary (one word for one thing, everywhere)
| Say | Never say | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Connection** | integration, plugin, connector | one of the things StagePilot talks to |
| **Services** | Planning Center (unless signing in to it) | the connection that supplies the service plan |
| **Presentation** | ProPresenter (unless an API screen needs it) | the connection that shows the countdown |
| **Playback** | MultiTracks | the connection that tells StagePilot a song started |
| **Lights** | lighting controller, Lightkey | the connection that receives cues |
| **MIDI** | (stays) | a connection method: alternate for Playback, main for Lights |
| **Configuration** | settings, setup, production setup | what you edit for a connection (decided) |
| **Basic / Advanced** | alternate, specific, manual | the two parts of Configuration |
| **StagePilot** | backend, local API, plugin health | the fifth status card; its panel holds the app's own status and all app-wide configuration |
| **Service plan** | plan | the day's list of songs (decided) |
| **Cue** | pulse | a message sent to Lights (decided) |
| **Note** | (stays) | the MIDI note a cue uses; the alternate, more descriptive word (decided) |
| **People** | remote users | who can sign in remotely |
| **Connected / Connecting / Not connected / Error** | disconnected | the four status words (sentence case in text, UPPERCASE in badges) |

### Labels and buttons
- Button labels are **verb + object**: `Save configuration`, `Scan for devices`,
  `Test connection`, `Discard changes`. Never `OK`, `Submit`, `Yes`.
- Sentence case everywhere, except badges and kickers (uppercase).
- Destructive buttons name what is lost (`Delete layout`); the safe option is
  on the left.
- A control is **disabled with a reason shown nearby**, never silently greyed.

### Configuration panel anatomy (every connection looks the same)
1. **Header:** kicker `Connection configuration` (muted), title = the
   connection name, status badge, close button (44px).
2. **One sentence** saying what this connection does for the user.
3. **Connection method** (when more than one), then **Basic**, ordered by how
   often they change.
4. **Advanced** (collapsed, see above).
5. **Save bar, always last and always in the same place** (see below).

### Saving (decided: save as you go, plus an always-visible Save configuration button)
- **Default: a change saves the moment it is made.** Selects and toggles save
  on change; text fields save when the user leaves the field or presses Enter.
- **The `Save configuration` button is always visible** at the bottom of every
  connection panel, for every kind of change, including ones that already saved
  by themselves. Reason: an operator can't be expected to know which controls
  auto-apply, and a missing button looks like a glitch. Pressing it when
  everything is already saved is harmless and just confirms (`All changes saved
  at 9:41 AM`). It is **never hidden**.
- **The save bar shows one of five states** (same wording in every panel):
  1. **Nothing changed:** `All changes saved`, button dimmed with the reason
     beside it ("No changes to save").
  2. **Saved automatically:** green check, `Saved automatically at 9:41 AM`,
     button ready to press to confirm.
  3. **Saving:** `Saving…`.
  4. **Waiting (held changes):** amber, `2 changes waiting. Not saved yet.`
     with `Discard` and a coral **`Save configuration`**. Held changes only take
     effect when this is pressed, **whether or not a show is running** (decided).
  5. **Couldn't save:** red, what failed and `Try again`; the field keeps its
     value.
- **Held until `Save configuration` (decided):** anything that could change what
  a running show uses.
  - **Services:** service type, service plan choice, `Reload service plan`.
  - **Presentation:** which timer or target receives the countdown.
  - **Playback:** connection method, which computer, velocities.
  - **Lights:** only the **MIDI network / output and the MIDI channel** (they can
    change everything being sent).
  - **StagePilot:** anything needing an app restart (port, network access,
    timezone).
- **Saved immediately, even during a show (decided):** all other Lights
  configuration (cue list, cue notes, velocities, labels, elapsed times, note
  names vs numbers) because operators need to add cues quickly during a show;
  tests; display preferences; PIN; names and labels.
- A held field is marked with an amber dot and `Not saved yet` until saved, so
  it's clear which controls wait and which don't.
- On phones the save bar is sticky at the bottom of the screen.
- The StagePilot panel uses the same bar.

### The StagePilot panel (decided)
The fifth card stays in the connections row, as the quick look at the app's
own health, and its panel replaces a separate app-settings page. **All
app-wide configuration that is not for one connection lives here.**
Sections, in order: **Status** (version, running state, connection health:
read-only), **Basic** (timezone, network access, PIN), **People** (remote
access and who can sign in), **Advanced** (port, logging, diagnostics).
New app-wide options go here, never into a connection.

### Form fields
- Label above the field (`text-strong`), hint under it in `text-muted`, error
  under that in `danger-text` with a short fix ("Enter a number from 1 to 16").
- Field height 44px; the label never sits to the left of a field.
- Validate when the user leaves the field, not on every keystroke.

### Feedback
- **Inline alert** for anything about the current panel (warning amber, error
  red, success green), under the thing it is about.
- **Toast** only for things the user did not just cause (crash, update).
- **Empty state:** one sentence saying what to do next plus one button.
- **Progress in a panel** uses the blue pixel bar; on phones, the spinner.

### Rules for adding anything new
1. Does it belong to a connection? Then it goes in that connection's
   Configuration, Basic or Advanced. If not, it goes in the StagePilot panel.
2. Could it change everything a running show sends or reads? Then it is a held change, saved with `Save configuration`. Everything else saves as you go.
3. Use an existing pattern from this file. If none fits, add the new pattern
   here first, then build it.
4. Name it from the Vocabulary table. Add any new word to the table.
5. It must work at 320px wide and with only a keyboard.
6. A new colour is never needed: status colours for state, the service colour
   for identity, coral for the one primary action.

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do use status colours only for state, integration hues only for identity.
- Do put light text on dark fills and dark text on light fills; check any new
  pair at 4.5:1 (use the linter).
- Do keep error colours reddish, including text on a light error fill.
- Do put new colours here first, then use the token. No raw hex in components.
- Do pair state colour with a word or icon (status cards already do).
- Don't use coral for decoration, or for more than one "live" item per view.
- Don't add radii, font sizes, shadows or z-indexes not listed here.

## How this drives the app

Today the app has **three** overlapping systems, which is the reason one file
cannot yet restyle everything:

| Layer | Where | Reach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--sp-*` CSS variables (18 defined) | `index.css` `:root` | used only by hand-written CSS classes (~14 distinct vars, ~35 refs); **0 refs in components** |
| `stage-*` Tailwind colours (5 defined) | `tailwind.config.js` | 1 shade (`stage-850`), 3 uses; 4 shades unused (now renamed or deleted in this file) |
| Stock Tailwind palette (`slate`, `emerald`, `amber`, `rose`, `sky`, `fuchsia`, `blue`, `orange`) | inline in ~25 component files | nearly everything, including 49 `text-white` |

Wiring plan once you approve the values (each step is a small PR; rendered
output is unchanged until you change a token):

1. `npx @google/design.md export` to generate the Tailwind theme and CSS
   variables from this file; replace both `:root` and `stage-*` with it.
2. Add semantic Tailwind names (`text-muted`, `bg-success`, `border`)
   and migrate components screen by screen; add a CI grep that blocks new
   raw hex and new stock-palette colours.
3. Add `design.md lint` to CI and a line in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Audit ledger: discrepancies found and how each was handled

| # | Finding | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Draft v1 said timer is Inter 900, 4rem. Real: mono, weight 300, clamp(3rem, 5vw, 5.4rem) | Fixed in tokens |
| 2 | Draft v1 listed `brand` at 1.5rem; real sizes are 4.05rem header and up to 11.25rem splash | Fixed; added `brand-hero` |
| 3 | Draft v1 claimed text pairs pass AA. `text-muted` (slate-500) is 3.4-4.2:1; `danger` as text 4.4:1; white on coral 3.0, rose-500 3.7, fuchsia-500 3.5 | `text-muted` CHANGED to `#7b8ba1`; others documented as rules |
| 4 | `--sp-*` vs rendered values differ (success `#42dda4` vs `#34d399`, warning `#f6c453` vs `#fbbf24`, info `#7dd3fc` vs `#38bdf8`, muted `#9aa9bb` vs `#94a3b8`, quiet `#718096`) | Rendered values used; `--sp-*` values listed as OPEN Q1 |
| 5 | `stage-800` / `stage-700` defined but never used; `stage-900` only in scrollbar CSS | Decided: delete both unused; `stage-850` -> `card`, `stage-900` -> `scrollbar-track` |
| 6 | Missing `panel`, `panel-strong`, dialog/toast/popover, scrim, widget borders | Added |
| 7 | Missing z-index scale (7 layers) with two apparent stacking conflicts | Added table; layering decided: keep as is |
| 8 | Missing: Inter not loaded; tap-target rule mostly unenforced; no placeholder style; two shadow languages; 3 button recipes | Decided: bundle Inter, 44/36px tap targets, placeholder style, new shadow, one panel recipe; coral is the only solid primary |
| 9 | Draft v1 listed `rounded` sm/md as in use; bare `rounded` (4px) is the real odd one | Documented |

| 10 | I said one timer used -0.045em vs -0.06em. Wrong: -0.045em is the song title heading, a different element | Corrected; `song-title` token added |
| 11 | Draft v2 had no text-colour rule for coloured fills; white on rose-500 (3.7), fuchsia-500 (3.5), sky-500 (2.8) fail | Rule decided; darker fills added |
| 12 | Live controls (4 severity colours) were not documented, and the red hover fill fails AA with white text | Documented as a deliberate exception; red hover fill darkened |
| 13 | Dashboard and docs used vendor brand names | Generic names decided; brand names only for OAuth/API-specific screens |

## Decisions made (owner, 2026-10-09)

**Principle:** the app must be usable by anyone without training. Nothing is
kept because the current code does it.

**Foundations**
- Three text steps (`text` warm, `text-body`, `text-muted`); `text-strong` is
  the same warm colour set bolder (700), not a separate colour.
- Three widget borders (6 / 10 / 18%). One warm layered default shadow (old
  shadow deleted); stronger levels 2 to 5 exist for the owner to choose.
- Light button labels carry a small very-dark-grey text shadow. Dark labels
  (on coral, amber, emerald, sky fills) carry none: the light shadow under dark
  text was tried and rejected.
- Advanced tones are 30% service colour mixed with 70% `text-muted`.
- Light text on dark fills, dark text on light fills; error text keeps its
  reddish colour. Contrast minimum 4.5:1 for text.
- Coral is the only solid primary button. Playback is fuchsia `#e879f9`;
  MIDI is a connection method, not a service colour. Live controls keep four
  severity colours.
- Inter is bundled. Three tracking steps; one 11px micro size; bare `rounded`
  becomes 8px. Inputs on `surface-950`.
- Photo background stays, fixed behind scrolling content. Blue loading bar
  stays; its white lead-in line is removed.
- Service icons are generic pixel-art illustrations (checklist, monitor with
  cursor, audio tracks), not vendor logos, and count as 8-bit moments.

**Sizes**
- 44px: live controls, inputs, and **every button on touch devices**
  (`@media (pointer: coarse)`). 36px buttons are for mouse pointers only.

**Patterns (see Patterns section)**
- Wide status cards above 1000px, compact below. Phone/remote loading is a
  spinner instead of the bar.
- Connection method select (Playback API main / MIDI alternate; Lights shows
  MIDI as text). Activity and Advanced rows look different; "Other computer…"
  replaces "Connect a specific computer".
- Vocabulary: Connection, Services, Presentation, Playback, Lights, MIDI,
  Configuration, Basic / Advanced, StagePilot, Service plan, Cue (not pulse),
  Note (kept), People.
- StagePilot card and panel hold all app-wide configuration.
- Save as you go, plus an always-visible `Save configuration` button and a
  five-state save bar. Held until saved: service type / plan choice / Reload
  service plan, Presentation timer target, Playback method / computer /
  velocities, Lights **MIDI network (output) and channel only**, StagePilot
  restart-needed items. Everything else applies immediately, including the
  rest of Lights.
- **Send test cue** runs when pressed, using the saved output. It is disabled
  (greyed, with the reason beside it) while a new MIDI output is selected but
