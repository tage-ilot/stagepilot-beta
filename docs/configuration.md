# Configuration

StagePilot starts with safe development defaults and validates configuration in
the backend. Ordinary settings persist as JSON, while the Planning Center PAT
secret is stored separately by the operating system. Environment variables
remain available for development and deployment overrides.

## Precedence

The active configuration order, from lowest to highest priority, is:

1. Application defaults committed with the backend.
2. `%APPDATA%\StagePilot\settings.json` on Windows.
3. Environment variables supplied by the process host.
4. Temporary validated changes supplied for the current process session.

The settings file is versioned, validated on read, and atomically replaced on
write. A corrupt or invalid file is left untouched and StagePilot starts from
safe defaults with a warning. `STAGEPILOT_SETTINGS_PATH` may point development
and test processes at a different file.

The most recently loaded Planning Center service is cached separately at
`%APPDATA%\StagePilot\last-known-good-service.json`. It contains only the plan,
service times, songs, durations, source IDs, and last refresh timestamp. A
Planning Center outage restores a non-expired cache as stale and shows a
warning; expired or mismatched service-type caches are not loaded.

`GET /api/v1/settings` returns ordinary settings and whether a Planning Center
secret has been saved. `PUT /api/v1/settings` validates and persists ordinary
settings. It never accepts or returns the PAT secret. Input-source, MIDI filter,
and Playback connection changes apply live. Other settings that affect plugin
registration still take effect after the backend restarts.

## General variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STAGEPILOT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | API bind address. Keep loopback-only by default. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PORT` | `8765` | Local FastAPI port, from 1 through 65535. |
| `STAGEPILOT_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Backend structured-log threshold. |
| `STAGEPILOT_SERVICE_SOURCE` | `demo` | `demo` or `planning_center`. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_SOURCE` | `playback_api` | `playback_api`, `simulated`, or `real` (native/network MIDI alternative). |
| `STAGEPILOT_TIMER_OUTPUT` | `simulated` | `simulated` or `propresenter`. |
| `STAGEPILOT_TIMEZONE` | `America/Los_Angeles` | IANA time zone used for local-date plan selection. |

The older `STAGEPILOT_DEMO_MODE`, `STAGEPILOT_DEMO_SIMULATE_MIDI`, and
`STAGEPILOT_DEMO_SIMULATE_PROPRESENTER` variables remain compatible during the
v0.5 migration. Prefer the three independent mode variables for new setups.

The backend reads variables from its process environment. It does not implicitly
load a root `.env` file. Copy `.env.example` to an ignored `.env`, then use a
trusted environment manager or export the variables before launching StagePilot.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:STAGEPILOT_LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
uv run --project backend stagepilot
```

POSIX shell example:

```sh
STAGEPILOT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG uv run --project backend stagepilot
```

## Playback input default and migration

Schema 2 switches schema-1/unversioned installations to Playback API while
preserving every saved MIDI value. Explicit environment source overrides still
win. The `playback_api` settings block defaults to `enabled: true`, `host: null`,
`port: 8080`, and `auto_scan: true`. No manual host means local-first discovery,
then attached-LAN scanning. A manual host exclusively overrides discovery.

Playback receives observations only, except the operator-confirmed Discover Song
Order operation, whose only commands are Next/Previous while Playback is stopped.
Only its completed/restored result saves `song_order`, `captured_version`, and
`captured_at`. Unknown IDs or changed/missing versions make the order stale and
block start/restart; pause/stop may still stop the timer outside discovery.
Reconnect revalidates its first snapshot rather than invalidating by itself.

`PUT /api/v1/playback-api/settings` applies on/off and endpoint settings live;
`GET /api/v1/playback-api/status`, `GET /events`, `POST /find`, and confirmed
`POST /discover-song-order` support the existing configuration window. MIDI
(shown in the collapsed "Alternate connection: MIDI settings" section of the Playback panel)
remains explicitly selectable with `integration_modes.midi_source: real`. In
default API mode, the saved MIDI input also stays open as automatic fallback.
One unified Playback connection is successful if either source connects. Healthy
API (WebSocket and heartbeat within five seconds) is the sole action owner after
three seconds of stable heartbeats when taking over from MIDI. API disconnect or
heartbeat expiry permits MIDI immediately; healthy API without valid song order
still owns but suppresses starts/restarts, never silently switching to MIDI.
Ignored MIDI actions remain visible as `ignored: Playback API active`. A
two-second cross-source action dedupe and queued ownership checks prevent replay
across failover/failback. `GET /api/v1/playback-api/status` adds `active_source`,
`sources`, and `reason`; its `connected` and application `midi_status` both describe
the unified connection. Use `sources.playback_api.connected` for API discovery
eligibility. `GET /api/v1/playback-api/connection` returns the unified fields only.
Explicit `real` mode disables the API; `simulated` disables both live listeners.
Source switching closes old listeners and discards old queues before restart.
See [Playback API](playback-api.md) for full route bodies, discovery limits,
monitor fields, safety guarantees and protocol limitations.

## Planning Center variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_APP_ID` | unset | Personal Access Token client ID. Treated as a server-side secret. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_SECRET` | unset | Personal Access Token secret. Treated as a server-side secret. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_SERVICE_TYPE_ID` | unset | Service type selected for Planning Center plan loading. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_PLAN_TITLE` | unset | Optional title preference used to resolve otherwise plausible plan matches. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_SERVICE_TIME` | unset | Optional preferred local service time in 24-hour `HH:MM` form. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS` | `30` | Future local dates searched when today has no match; accepts 0 through 365. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `10` | HTTP request timeout, from 1 through 60 seconds. |
| `STAGEPILOT_PCO_USER_AGENT` | StagePilot project URL | Required identifying header sent to Planning Center. |

The application ID may be saved in ordinary settings. The PAT secret is stored
under the `StagePilot` service in Windows Credential Manager through Python's
`keyring` package. An incomplete credential set is valid while onboarding is in
progress, but Planning Center will not connect until both values are present.
The secret remains absent from the settings file, public application state,
URLs, logs, API responses, and outward-facing credential-backend errors.

`POST /api/v1/planning-center/settings` saves the non-secret Planning Center
fields and can replace or remove the credential-store secret. `GET
/api/v1/planning-center/status` returns only a boolean saved-secret state plus
the public setup fields. `POST /api/v1/planning-center/test` tests temporary or
saved credentials without persisting temporary values. `GET
/api/v1/planning-center/service-types` uses the effective saved credentials and
returns active service types for the dashboard dropdown. The typed client can discover service types,
prefer plans with service times on today's configured local date, fall back to
the nearest upcoming service date within the lookahead window, surface
same-date ambiguous matches, and parse a selected plan's ordered songs. Past
plans, plans without service times, and plans containing only non-service times
are not eligible. Demo mode remains the safe default. When demo mode is
disabled, StagePilot registers only the production Planning Center plugin,
loads the configured service type at startup, and handles dashboard reload and
plan-selection requests.

`STAGEPILOT_PCO_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS` defaults to `30`; set it to `0` to disable the
fallback. The fallback runs only when
today has no qualifying plan; a plan today always wins over every future plan.
If several plans share the nearest upcoming service date, StagePilot asks the
operator to choose among those plans and does not offer plans on later dates. A
not-found result means no eligible service plan exists today or within the
configured future window.

For a local production-integration smoke test, set all required values in the
launching process. Do not paste real values into tracked files:

```powershell
$env:STAGEPILOT_SERVICE_SOURCE = "planning_center"
$env:STAGEPILOT_TIMEZONE = "America/Los_Angeles"
$env:STAGEPILOT_PCO_APP_ID = "<your application id>"
$env:STAGEPILOT_PCO_SECRET = "<your secret>"
$env:STAGEPILOT_PCO_SERVICE_TYPE_ID = "<your service type id>"
$env:STAGEPILOT_PCO_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS = "30"
uv run --project backend stagepilot
```

An unsuccessful refresh leaves the last valid current or upcoming plan in
memory and marks it stale. A preloaded upcoming plan remains available as local
calendar days advance toward it. Once its service date has passed, it is cleared
and its running timer is stopped and reset rather than remaining actionable.
Not-found and ambiguous outcomes keep Planning Center connected; the dashboard
displays them as plan-readiness states and allows explicit selection when
several plans share the selected service date.

Planning Center documents Personal Access Tokens as appropriate for local tools
used with one organization. A future multi-organization StagePilot distribution
must use OAuth instead of collecting PAT credentials. See Planning Center's
[authentication documentation](https://api.planningcenteronline.com/docs/overview/authentication).

The dashboard presents a six-step first-launch checklist:

1. Review and save timezone, log level, and server port under **StagePilot backend**.
2. Enter the Planning Center PAT application ID and secret, test the connection,
   choose a discovered service type, and save. Saving enables the real Planning
   Center source automatically.
3. Save the MIDI channel, fixed note, velocities, and debounce settings. Restart,
   refresh the available inputs, and select the Playback input.
4. Save the ProPresenter API and countdown timer settings. Saving enables the real
   ProPresenter output automatically.
5. Test all three integration connections.
6. Confirm that a current or upcoming service and valid song durations are loaded.

The production configuration panels intentionally do not offer demo or simulated
sources. Simulation modes remain backend development overrides only.

## MIDI Playback variables

Playback API is preferred by default, with the configured real MIDI input kept
as fallback. MIDI uses an operating-system input port and
needs no client ID, API key, password, or other secret. The environment variable
remains available as a higher-priority development override.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_SOURCE` | `playback_api` | API preferred with MIDI fallback; `real` selects MIDI only, `simulated` disables both live inputs. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_INPUT_NAME` | unset | Exact, unique startup input-port name. An unset name starts disconnected and still allows discovery. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_CHANNEL` | `1` | One-based MIDI channel to accept, from 1 through 16. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_NOTE` | `112` (E7 in Playback) | Fixed note accepted for all StagePilot cues. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_START_NEXT_VELOCITY` | `100` | Starts the next song and its timer. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_RESTART_CURRENT_VELOCITY` | `101` | Restarts the current song and timer. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_PREVIOUS_VELOCITY` | `102` | Selects the previous song. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_NEXT_VELOCITY` | `103` | Selects the next song. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_RELOAD_PLAN_VELOCITY` | `104` | Requests a Planning Center plan reload. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_STOP_TIMER_VELOCITY` | `105` | Stops the active timer. |
| `STAGEPILOT_MIDI_DEBOUNCE_MS` | `250` | Duplicate note-on suppression window, from 0 through 2000 milliseconds. |

Playback song-start cues use velocities `1` through `99` as one-based service
plan positions: velocity `1` starts the first loaded song, velocity `2` starts
the second, and so on. StagePilot rejects a position that does not exist in the
loaded plan. Velocities `100` through `127` are reserved for the configurable
action mappings above. Manual dashboard controls continue to dispatch their
actions directly and are unaffected by this MIDI protocol.

Mapped action velocities must be distinct integers from 100 through 127. A qualifying
note-on must use the configured note and channel and have a mapped velocity;
note-off, including note-on with velocity zero, releases the held-note latch.

The MIDI channel is a logical lane inside the selected MIDI input port, not the
Playback bus or the position of that bus in Playback's list. One port carries up
to 16 channels. With StagePilot set to channel 1, it accepts matching notes sent
on Playback channel 1 and shows messages from channels 2–16 as `wrong_channel`.
Change this only when the Playback cue is intentionally transmitting on a
different channel, and configure both applications to the same one-based value.

`STAGEPILOT_MIDI_INPUT_NAME` is the environment-level startup override. For a
normal installation, save the channel, fixed note, action velocities, and
debounce in the dashboard. If the real MIDI plugin is already running, those cue
filter settings apply immediately. Enabling the plugin for the first time still
requires a restart before StagePilot can discover and select the input. For
development, leave the environment input unset to begin disconnected and
discover available ports:

```powershell
$env:STAGEPILOT_MIDI_SOURCE = "real"
$env:STAGEPILOT_MIDI_CHANNEL = "1"
Remove-Item Env:STAGEPILOT_MIDI_INPUT_NAME -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
uv run --project backend stagepilot
```

The dashboard MIDI panel edits channel 1–16, fixed note 0–127, debounce 0–2000
milliseconds, and six unique action velocities from 1–127. Use **Refresh inputs**
to enumerate ports, choose an available input to connect, or disconnect the
current input. An accepted selection is saved to the local settings file and
reused on the next launch unless an environment override is present.

The REST API exposes the same flow. In another PowerShell window, refresh the
input list and inspect the returned opaque IDs:

```powershell
$inputs = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/midi/inputs/refresh"
$inputs | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

Select one returned input by its `id`. Treat the ID as opaque; do not construct
it from the port name:

```powershell
$body = @{ input_id = "<opaque id from refresh>" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/midi/input-selection" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

Send `null` to disconnect without stopping the backend:

```powershell
$body = @{ input_id = $null } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/midi/input-selection" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

Environment variables are read when the backend starts, so changing an
environment override or enabling/disabling the real MIDI source requires a
restart. Dashboard changes to the channel, note, velocity mapping, and debounce
take effect immediately when the plugin is already running. Input selections
also take effect immediately and persist without requiring a restart. The plugin
monitors the selected port and retries a missing or failed input with capped
backoff; a disconnected device keeps health degraded until it reconnects.

Manual simulation accepts one of `start_next`, `restart_current`, `previous`,
`next`, `reload_plan`, or `stop_timer`. It enters the same ordered cue pipeline
and application action dispatcher as a hardware note, so it can change the
loaded song or timer state and should be treated as a real control:

```powershell
$body = @{ cue = "start_next" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/midi/cue-simulation" `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

`GET /api/v1/midi/inputs` returns the current MIDI setup snapshot. When the
plugin is disabled, discovery returns `enabled: false` with no active inputs;
input selection and cue simulation return HTTP 409. A selection request also
returns HTTP 409 if its ID is stale, unavailable, or refers to an ambiguous port
name. Simulation can exercise the cue path while an enabled plugin is
disconnected, but it does not mark the MIDI input as connected or make its
health ready.

The same rule applies throughout the dashboard: **Connected** means StagePilot
has verified the real external integration during the current backend runtime.
Demo plans, simulated MIDI actions, and simulated countdowns remain useful for
testing, but their Planning Center, MIDI, and ProPresenter cards stay
**Disconnected**. Missing or disabled configuration is also disconnected rather
than an error. A demo plan is labeled separately and does not satisfy production
service-plan readiness; ProPresenter API connectivity and discovery of the
configured timer are separate readiness checks.

The production dashboard also polls `GET /api/v1/midi/messages` for a bounded
live note monitor. It displays the selected input, note-on or note-off type,
one-based channel, note name and number, velocity, and whether StagePilot
dispatched or ignored the message. Wrong-channel, unmapped, duplicate, rejected,
and release messages remain visible for routing and mapping diagnosis. The MIDI
settings panel offers every note from 0 through 127 in a named dropdown and
defaults to E7 (MIDI 112). Note names use Playback's octave convention, where
MIDI note 0 is displayed as C-2; the MIDI number remains the authoritative
mapping value.

## Network configuration

The packaged backend serves the browser dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`
and its WebSocket endpoint at `ws://127.0.0.1:8765/ws`. When the server port is
saved in the general settings panel, the dashboard remembers it for its next
launch. Browser-hosted copies use the same host and port from which the page was
loaded.

For a different development API origin, copy `frontend/.env.example` to
`frontend/.env.local` and set `VITE_STAGEPILOT_API_URL`. Vite embeds every
`VITE_*` value into public browser assets, so this setting must never contain a
credential or other secret.

The **Allow dashboard access from this local network** setting binds the
packaged backend to all network interfaces after StagePilot restarts. Other
devices can then open `http://<stagepilot-computer-ip>:<server-port>`.

Browser dashboard PIN protection is enabled by default with the initial PIN
`1234`. Replace that PIN in **StagePilot backend** before enabling LAN access.
The PIN gate appears before the browser loading screen and protects both API
and WebSocket access. The desktop application bypasses this browser-only gate.
The saved PIN is stored as a salted password hash, not as readable text.
Disabling **Require a PIN for web dashboards** removes the gate.

LAN mode does not provide TLS, so PIN protection is an access barrier for a
trusted private network rather than permission to expose StagePilot to the
internet. See [security.md](security.md).

## Local files

The following patterns are ignored because they can contain secrets or
machine-specific state:

- `.env` and `.env.*` except `.env.example`
- `*.local.json`, `*.local.toml`, `*.local.yaml`, and `*.local.yml`
- `.stagepilot/`
- logs and process identifiers

Exported configuration should omit credentials by default. A future diagnostic
bundle must use explicit allow-lists and redaction rather than serializing the
complete settings object.

## ProPresenter recovery settings

The ProPresenter plugin reconnects automatically and periodically rediscovers the configured timer.

```dotenv
STAGEPILOT_PROPRESENTER_RECONNECT_INITIAL_SECONDS=1
STAGEPILOT_PROPRESENTER_RECONNECT_MAX_SECONDS=30
STAGEPILOT_PROPRESENTER_HEALTH_CHECK_SECONDS=10
```

The dashboard can change host, port, timer name, and request timeout. Accepted
values are persisted to the local settings file and reused after restart.

## Lights MIDI output

The dashboard **Lights** panel is the normal configuration path. Its output
port, channel, Note On/Off pulse length, and per-song cue maps are stored in the
ordinary StagePilot settings file. Cue maps use the stable Planning Center
source song ID when one is available.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STAGEPILOT_LIGHTS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the lighting MIDI output plugin. |
| `STAGEPILOT_LIGHTS_OUTPUT_NAME` | unset | Exact MIDI output name, including a connected macOS Network MIDI session. |
| `STAGEPILOT_LIGHTS_CHANNEL` | `1` | One-based output channel from 1 through 15. |
| `STAGEPILOT_LIGHTS_PULSE_MS` | `100` | Delay between Note On and Note Off, from 10 through 2000 milliseconds. |

See [lights.md](lights.md) for routing and timeline behavior.
